\section*{Abstract}
We present studies of proton fluxes in the T10 beamline at CERN.
A prototype High Pressure gas Time Projection Chamber was exposed to the beam of protons, using the 0.8~GeV/c momentum setting in T10, in order to make measurements of low energy protons in argon.
To explore the energy region comparable to hadrons produced by GeV neutrino interactions at oscillation experiments, i.e. near 0.1~GeV, methods of moderating the T10 beam were employed:
the dual technique of moderating the beam with acrylic blocks and measuring scattered protons off the beam axis was used to decrease the kinetic energy of protons measured, as well as change the p/$\pi$/$\mu$ composition of the incident flux.
Measurements of properties of the beam were made using time of flight systems upstream and downstream of the vessel. 
The kinetic energy of protons reaching the vessel was successfully changed from $\sim$0.3~GeV without moderator blocks to less than 0.1~GeV with four moderator blocks (40~cm path length) .
The flux of both protons and minimum ionising particles off the beam axis was increased, with the ratio of the two varying as a function of off-axis angle. 
Simulation informed by the time of flight measurements show that with four moderator blocks placed in the beamline,  ($5.56 \pm 0.10$) protons with energies below 0.1~GeV per spill traversed the active TPC region.
Measurements of the beam composition and energy are presented.
