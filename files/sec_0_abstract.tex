\section{Abstract}

A prototype High Pressure gas Time Projection Chamber was operated at CERN in the T10 beamline. The vessel was exposed to a beam of protons of 0.8~GeV/c momentum in order to make measurements of low momentum protons in argon.
To explore the low momentum hadron region below 500~MeV/c, comparable to hadrons produced in neutrino events at oscillation experiments, methods of moderating the T10 beam were employed:
the dual technique of placing acrylic moderator in the beamline and placing the vessel off the beam axis was used to decrease the momentum of protons measured, as well as change the proton/$\pi$/$\mu$ composition of the incident flux.
Measurements of properties of the beam were made using time of flight systems upstream and downstream of the vessel. The momentum range of protons reaching the vessel was successfully changed from 0.55-0.65~GeV/c with 0~moderator blocks to 0.30-0.45~GeV/c with 4~moderator blocks.
The flux of both protons and minimum ionising particles was increased off the beam axis, with the ratio of the two produced varying as a function of off axis angle. Detailed results of the beam composition measurements are presented.
