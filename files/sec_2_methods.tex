	\subsection{UsToF instrumentation}

	\subsection{DsToF instrumentation}
	
    The downstream time of flight (DsToF) system consists of 10 bars of Nuvia plastic scintillator, which form the detector medium. Attached to either end of each of these scintillator bars is a 5" Hamamatsu R6594 photomultiplier tube. The bars are arranged in two rows of five, such that there is complete coverage for any beam particles incident upon the detector. Diagrams of the downstream time of flight system along with its dimensions are show in figure~\ref{fig:dstofFront} and~\ref{fig:dstofDiagonal}.
    
    The time resolution of the bars and PMTs was measured to be 1~ns. The spatial resolution of the bars and PMTs was measured to be 8.3~cm.

    	\end{minipage}
    \end{figure}
    
    All 20 of the photomultiplier tubes have their anode signals read out using NIM discriminators which are then fed into a time-to-digital converter. 
    
    A signal (i.e. an incident particle of any kind) in the downstream time of flight system was considered to have occurred if a signal was seen in both photomultiplier tubes on the same bar within 20~ns of each other.
    
    Additionally, a signal is also fed into the same time-to-digital converter whenever there is a coincidence between the $S_1$ and $S_2$ timing points. When calculating the time of flight of a given particle, this time of coincidence is used as first timing point.
    
	\subsection{Analysis methods -- $S_{4}$}

	Figure~\ref{fig:s4tof} shows the variation in the time of flight spectrum as recorded by the DsToF with a changing number of moderator blocks. This spectrum is formed from taking the difference in time between a coincidence being observed in the $S1$ and $S2$ timing points and a signal being recorded in $S4$ (the definition of an $S4$ signal is given above).

		\label{fig:s4tof}	
	\end{figure}

	Furthermore, two corrections are applied to this measurement to give fig.~\ref{fig:s4tof}. Timing delays caused by cabling and equipment have to be taken into account. For this, a Gaussian is fitted to the peak caused by quicker particles and the mean of this is treated to have a value of $S4 - S1$ which corresponds to a particle traversing the distance between $S1$ and $S4$ at the speed of light. The other times are then shifted by the same amount.
	
	Additionally, the measurements are adjusted for the efficiency of each bar. The efficiency of each bar is calculated by taking the number of signal hits in coincidence with an $S1-S2$ signal in each bar and dividing by the total number of PMT hits in each bar which are themselves in coincidence with an $S1-S2$ signal. If we express the number of single PMT hits which are in coincidence with $S1-S2$ signal as $N_{1PMTcoins}$ and the number of 2 PMT signals in coincidence with an $S1-S2$ signal as $N_{2PMTcoins}$ then the efficiency is given by~(\ref{eq:barEff}).
	
	\begin{equation}
		\epsilon = \frac{N_{2PMTcoins}}{N_{2PMTcoins}+N_{1PMTcoins}}
		\label{eq:barEff}
	\end{equation}
	
	Using fig.~\ref{fig:s4tof} protons and MIPs are selected with timing cuts.
