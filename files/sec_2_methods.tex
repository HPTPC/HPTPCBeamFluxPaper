\section{Beam Line and Detectors}
\label{hptpcPaper:sec:Methods}

\subsection{Beam Test Overview}
The beam test took place in the T10 beam line, in the East Area at the Proton Synchrotron (PS) at CERN.
The T10 beamline at CERN is a secondary beam derived from the PS beam which consists primarily of protons, electrons and charged pions~\cite{T10Report}.
%The results in this paper use data taken on the 28th August and 1st September, during which the setup configuration was varied as described below.
The primary components of the experimental setup are shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:setup}.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Schematic diagram (plan view) of the HPTPC beam test configuration in the T10 area at CERN.}
  \label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}

  \caption{Photos illustrating the ToF constituents. Left: the downstream part of the setup which shows the $\mathit{S3}$, $\mathit{S4}$ detectors and HPTPC. Right: $\mathit{S1}$ and $\mathit{S2}$ counters and the stand with four acrylic moderator blocks.}
  \label{fig:modblocks}
\end{figure}

A beam position monitor (BPM) was situated at the beam entrance into the test area, upstream of all the ToF constituents and the TPC. 
The TPC was placed 13~m downstream of the BPM. 
From initial GEANT4~\cite{brun1993geant} beam simulations, the optimal TPC position was determined to be between 2$^{ \circ }$ and 3$^{ \circ }$ off the beam axis, but space constraints meant the TPC could not be placed that far away from the nominal beam centre. So, the beam was steered approximately 1$^{ \circ }$ away from its nominal position, and the TPC placed 1.5$^{ \circ }$ away from the nominal beam centre so that the TPC active region subtended an off-axis angular range of 1.4--3.8$^{ \circ }$.

There were four ToF constituents: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathit{S1}$, a small-area beam trigger, see Section~\ref{subsec:s1s2Exp};
    \item $\mathit{S2}$, a coincidence measurement with $\mathit{S1}$, see Section~\ref{subsec:s1s2Exp};
    \item $\mathit{S3}$, a wall of plastic scintillator bars placed directly upstream of the TPC vessel, see Section~\ref{subsec:s3Exp};
    \item $\mathit{S4}$, a wall of plastic scintillator bars placed directly downstream of the TPC vessel, see Section~\ref{subsec:s4Exp}.
\end{itemize}

A series of acrylic (polymethyl methacrylate) blocks was placed between the $\mathit{S1}$ and $\mathit{S2}$ counters.
Up to four $10\times10\times10$~cm$^3$ acrylic blocks could be placed contiguously on a tripod stand.
Figure~\ref{fig:modblocks} shows the stand with four blocks installed.
The moderator blocks have the effect of both reducing the energies of incoming particles as well as changing their directions.
This tends to increase the proton-to-MIP ratio at low off-axis angles from the beam, while decreasing the total number of protons and MIPs traversing the TPC.
Data were collected with the T10 beam momentum setting at 0.8~GeV/c, and with each configuration of 0 to 4 moderator blocks.

%The ToF systems were placed in off-axis positions with respect to the direction of the beam to match the TPC position.
The data acquisition (DAQ) systems of the $\mathit{S3}$ (upstream) and $\mathit{S4}$ (downstream) ToF systems were completely independent.
Synchronization between ToF DAQ systems was performed offline using the reference signal from the PS at the beginning of every spill.
T10 received 1--3 spills from the PS during each supercycle, which has a typical duration of 33~s.
The spill duration is 400~ms.
The minimum separation in time between two spills is 1 second, so the start-of-spill signal frequency is less than or equal to 1~Hz.
The trigger condition of the upstream ToF ($\mathit{S3}$) was based on the coincidence between $\mathit{S1}$ and $\mathit{S3}$ constituents.
$\mathit{S2}$ signals were also recorded by the upstream ToF DAQ but were not used in the trigger.
The DAQ of the downstream ToF ($\mathit{S4}$) was run in self-triggering mode with a gate open during the spill.
Coincidence signals between $\mathit{S1}$ and $\mathit{S2}$ counters were also recorded by the downstream ToF ($\mathit{S4}$) DAQ and were used in the particle identification (PID) analysis, described in Section~\ref{hptpcPaper:sec:Results}.  

\subsection{Survey and coordinate system}
\label{sec:coord}
The T10 beamline area was surveyed, and the distances to specific components measured with a precision of 0.5~mm by the CERN Survey, Mechatronics and Measurements (SMM) group.
Multiple points on each of $\mathit{S1}$, $\mathit{S2}$, $\mathit{S3}$, $\mathit{S4}$ and the TPC frame have had their positions measured.

The axes of a right-handed coordinate system are defined as follows: $\hat{x}$ refers to the non-beam horizontal direction, $\hat{y}$ to the vertical direction, and $\hat{z}$ the beam direction, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:setup}.
We show results in terms of two off-axis angles: $\theta$, which is measured in the $\hat{x}-\hat{z}$ plane with positive angles measured in the $+\hat{x}$ direction, and $\phi$, which is measured in the $\hat{y}-\hat{z}$ plane with positive angles measured in the $+\hat{y}$ direction.
The origin is taken to be at $\mathit{S1}$.

Figure~\ref{fig:angularDistS1} shows the angular extent of objects within the beamline using the coordinate system defined above.
Table~\ref{tab:angS1} shows the calculated angular extent of the various beamline components as measured from $\mathit{S1}$.
Table~\ref{tab:distances} shows the distances between the centres of various objects in the T10 beamline.
These distances were calculated using the data gathered by the survey team.

\subsection{Upstream beam counters (S1 and S2)}
\label{subsec:s1s2Exp}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{files/Figures/S1S2FrontOn.png}
  \caption{The S1 and S2 beam counters. Together the coincidence of signals in the beam counters were recorded by the DAQ systems}
  \label{fig:S1S2headon}
\end{figure}
The beam counters $\mathit{S1}$ and $\mathit{S2}$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:S1S2headon}.
The $\mathit{S1}$ counter is a $40\times40\times5$~mm$^3$ plastic scintillator cross which is attached to four 1'' Hamamatsu Photonics R4998 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) at each end for the light readout.
The time resolution of the counter, as measured by the DAQ system of the upstream ToF, was about 30~ps. This is estimated with the distribution of the average PMT hit times; the quantity $t_{\textrm{ave}}=\frac{1}{4}((t_{\textrm{PMT0}}+t_{\textrm{PMT1}})-(t_{\textrm{PMT2}}+t_{\textrm{PMT3}}))$ has the same spread as the simple average but is conveniently centered at zero.
An example of the $t_{\textrm{ave}}$ distribution for one run of $\mathit{S1}$ data is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:s1Res}. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the distribution is 62 ps.

\begin{figure}

  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{An example of the timing spread of $\mathit{S1}$ hits. The time is calculated as an average of the hit time as measured in each of the four PMTs.}
  \label{fig:s1Res}
\end{figure}

The $\mathit{S2}$ counter is a scintillator tile of size $120\times120\times5$~mm$^3$, coupled to a 2" Hamamatsu Photonics R1309 PMT~\cite{Hamamatsu}, via a long light-guide as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:modblocks}.
The $\mathit{S2}$ counter was placed $(1.419 \pm 0.001)~\text{m}$ downstream of $\mathit{S1}$.
The transverse position of $\mathit{S2}$ was adjusted to account for the beam divergence in the moderator blocks.

The analog signals from one of the $\mathit{S1}$ PMTs and the $\mathit{S2}$ PMT were fed into LeCroy 620AL NIM discriminator units with a threshold of 30~mV.
Subsequently, the discriminated signals were fed into a NIM coincidence unit, whose output was recorded by the DAQ systems of the downstream ToF ($\mathit{S4}$) wall.
This information was further used for the time-of-flight analysis of $\mathit{S4}$.

\subsection{Upstream Time of Flight instrumentation (S3)}
\label{subsec:s3Exp}
The $\mathit{S3}$ `upstream' ToF constituent was placed $(1.323 \pm 0.001)~\text{m}$ upstream of the upstream side of the HPTPC drift volume in the beamline.
A schematic drawing of the $\mathit{S3}$ ToF wall is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:S3sketch}.
The detector comprises 22 staggered scintillator bars:  20 bars with dimensions $168 \times 6.0 \times 1.0$~cm$^3$ and 2 bars of  $150 \times 6.0 \times 1.0$~cm$^3$ placed on top and bottom~\cite{S3-proceedings}.
The overlap between bars was set to 5~mm, thus the active area of the detector was $2.0214~\text{cm}^{2}$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.54\linewidth]{files/Figures/uToF_sketch.pdf}
  \hfill
  \includegraphics[width=0.43\linewidth]{files/Figures/uTOF_rot.pdf}
  \caption{Sketch of the $\mathit{S3}$ wall \cite{S3-proceedings}.
  Front (left) and rotated (right) views are presented.}
  \label{fig:S3sketch}
\end{figure}

The bars are made from EJ-200~\cite{SCIONIX} plastic scintillator, which provides a brightness of 10,000~photons/MeV~deposited.
It also has a suitable optical attenuation length of 4~m and fast timing, with a rise time of 0.9~ns and decay time constant of 2.1~ns.
The scintillation emission spectrum of EJ-200 peaks in the violet region of the visible spectrum (435~nm)~\cite{EJ200}, which matches well to the photon detection efficiency wavelength range of the photosensors used for the readout.
The bars were wrapped in an aluminium foil (60\% reflectivity) to increase the collected light.

Arrays of eight $6 \times 6$~mm$^2$ area silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) S13360-6050PE from Hamamatsu Photonics \cite{Hamamatsu} were coupled to each end of the bar to collect scintillation photons.
The photon detection efficiency at the peak sensitivity wavelength (450~nm) is 40\%~\cite{Hamamatsu}.
The anode signals of the SiPMs are read out, summed and shaped by a dedicated circuit as described in Ref.\,\cite{S3-readout}.
%an 8-channel SiPM anode readout integrated circuit MUSIC-R1. %The construction of the prototype was a joint effort between groups of Geneva and Zurich universities as a part of R\&D for the Timing detector of the SHIP experiment \cite{AK}.

$\mathit{S3}$ uses a 64 channel data acquisition system based on the SAMPIC chip.
A SAMPIC chip is a waveform and time to digital converter (WTDC) 16-channel ASIC which provides a raw time with ultrafast analog memory allowing fine timing extraction as well as other parameters of the pulse~\cite{SAMPIC}.
Each channel contains a discriminator that can trigger itself independently or participate in a more complex combined trigger. 
Three ASIC modules ($16\times3=48$ channels) were connected to the 44 channels of $\mathit{S3}$ and were operated in self-triggering mode.

The trigger conditions are as follows. At least three out of the four $\mathit{S1}$ PMTs must have a signal above a 30~mV threshold.
Additionally, there must be at least one signal in $\mathit{S3}$ above 30~mV.
These $\mathit{S1}$ and $\mathit{S3}$ signals must be coincident within a gate of 70~ns.
A fourth ASIC was used to acquire data from $\mathit{S1}$, the coincidence signal $\mathit{S1} \cap \mathit{S2}$, and the start-of-spill signal from the PS.
%A second level trigger was implemented in firmware and run on the level of the ASICs: the data were only sent to the hard disk of the DAQ computer if there was a coincidence between the $\mathit{S1}$ channels and at least one of the channels in the ASICs used for $\mathit{S3}$.
The mean time of light signals detected at both ends of a single bar provides a time reference with a resolution of about 100~ps, while the difference between the time of the light signals gives the position of the interaction along the bar, with a resolution of 1.6~cm.

Examples of reconstructed $\mathit{S3}$ spatial distributions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:s3XY_pion}.
Figure~\ref{fig:s3XY_pion}, left, shows the spatial distribution of hits in $\mathit{S3}$ thought to be produced by MIPs when no moderator was present in the beamline.
Figure~\ref{fig:s3XY_pion}, right, shows the spatial distribution of hits identified in $\mathit{S3}$ as protons when 4 moderator blocks were in the beamline.
The pattern of hits is more diffuse, illustrating the scattering effect of the moderator blocks.
When in this position the horizontal FWHM of the beam is 16.8~cm while the vertical FWHM is 5.5~cm.

\subsection{Downstream Time of Flight instrumentation (S4)}
\label{subsec:s4Exp}
The $\mathit{S4}$ `downstream' ToF constituent sat $(0.918 \pm 0.001)~\text{m}$ downstream of the downstream edge of the drift volume of the HPTPC prototype in the beamline.
It consists of 10 bars of Nuvia NuDET plastic scintillator which has a wavelength of maximum emission of 425~nm and a decay time constant of 2.5~ns~\cite{Nuvia}.
Each of these bars measure $10 \times 1 \times 140$~cm$^3$. 
Attached to each end of these scintillator bars is a 5" Hamamatsu Photonics R6594 PMT~\cite{Hamamatsu}.
The bars are arranged in two rows of five, such that there is complete coverage for any beam particles incident upon the detector.
The bar are wrapped individually in reflective milar sheets to increase the light yield.
The total active area of the $\mathit{S4}$ wall is $1.40 \times 0.78$~m$^2$.
A diagram of $\mathit{S4}$ along with its dimensions is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:dstofDiagram}.

The time resolution of the bars and PMTs is measured to be 1~ns using a $^{90}$Sr source placed at measured distances along the bar.
Figure~\ref{fig:s4Res} is the measured time difference for signals coming from the PMTs at either end of a bar caused by the $^{90}$Sr at a given position
Figre~\ref{fig:s4Res} shows an example of the distribution from which the time resolution was derived.
The corresponding spatial resolution of the bars and PMTs was measured to be 7~cm.

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \caption{Front (left) and rotated (right) view of the $\mathit{S4}$. The rotated view shows more clearly the staggering of the scintillator bars and PMTs.}
  \label{fig:dstofDiagram}
\end{figure}

The anode signals of all 20 of the PMTs are discriminated using LeCroy 620AL NIM discriminators, at a threshold of 20~mV.
The discriminated signals are then fed into a time-to-digital converter (TDC). A signal in $\mathit{S4}$ is deemed to have occurred if a signal is seen in both PMTs, above the discriminator threshold, on the same bar within 20~ns of each other. 
This timing window is determined through testing performed with a $^{90}$Sr source at known positions on the bar.

The $\mathit{S1-S2}$ coincidence signal is digitized by the same TDC. This signal is used to calculate the particle time of flight from $\mathit{S2}$ to $\mathit{S4}$.

\subsection{The HPTPC Prototype}
For the characterisation of the beam using the ToF systems described in this paper, the relevant characteristics of the HPTPC prototype are the location and thickness of the steel vessel walls.
The cylindrical steel vessel has a 142~cm outer diameter; the main body is 60 cm in length and the rounded end caps protrude an additional 37~cm on each end.
With 1~cm thick walls it is rated to 6~barA of pressure.
The vessel wall thickness is equivalent to the range of a proton with a kinetic energy of approximately 80~MeV~\cite{rangeTables}.
The angular position of the center of the TPC is approximately $\theta = -2.5^{\circ}$. 
More details of the position and extent of the TPC are given in Table~\ref{tab:angS1} and Table~\ref{tab:distances}.
 
The active TPC is a cylinder, 111~cm in diameter and 48~cm in length; the TPC comprised thin steel mesh electrodes (one cathode and three anodes), and 12 copper rings to create the uniform drift field. The anodes were supported by a hexagonal aluminium stiffener on the side facing away from the camera.
Data taking with the TPC made use of both optical and charge readout.
The vessel, electrodes, and drift region of the TPC are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TPC}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.88\linewidth]{files/Figures/vesselView.pdf}
  \caption{Cross-sectional view of the TPC; the thin mesh electrodes and copper ring drift volume can be seen inside the steel vessel. The walls of the vessel shown are 1~cm thick with a vessel outer diameter of 142~cm. At the point of hitting the vessel, the beam centre was 1~cm below the centre of the vessel vertically, where the distance from the inside of the vessel wall to the drift region was 15~cm.}
   \label{fig:TPC}
   %Vessel: wall thickness 1cm, beam centre height -1.14cm, 
\end{figure}

Throughout the run, the TPC was filled with either pure argon, or a combination of argon and a small percentage of quencher.
The performance of this TPC is the subject of a forthcoming publication~\cite{Deisting:2020aaa}.

\section{Analysis}
\label{hptpcPaper:sec:Analysis}
\subsection{Analysis Goals}

The primary aim of this analysis are to assess the feasibility of using the combination of off-axis positioning and a moderated beam to produce particles with momenta covering the range of momenta of particles produced in GeV-scale neutrino interactions and to characterize the incident flux on the TPC and exiting the TPC, for the TPC data analysis.

The numbers of spills recorded for each number of moderator blocks are shown in Table~\ref{tab:spills}.
More data were collected for 4 blocks as that was the configuration used for the majority of the beam test.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Total number of spills recorded for each moderator block configuration included in this paper.}

\subsection{Time of flight analysis}
\label{timeofflightanalysissubsec}

%Protons take longer to travel the distance from \textit{S1} to \textit{S3} or \textit{S4} than lighter particles that are close to being minimum ionising.
%This difference in time of flight can be used to distinguish between the two types of particles.
%Distinguishing these MIPs from one another is more difficult due to their similar masses and can be only determined by the upstream ToF system.
%From the particle flux data, it is possible to measure the ratio of protons to other particles over the range of off-axis angles covered by the \textit{S3} and \textit{S4} walls, and for varying numbers of moderator blocks.

A particle of mass $m$ with momentum $p$ will traverse a distance $d$ in a time
\begin{align}
  t = d \sqrt{\frac{m^2}{p^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}} \,, 
\end{align}
where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.
Therefore, particles with a greater momentum or smaller mass will cross the same distance in a shorter time.
This means that a beam of particles of different species but with the same momenta (as is produced by magnetic selection) can be separated by particle mass by measuring the time of flight, $t$.

For example, a charged pion with a momentum of 0.8~GeV/c will have a time of flight from $\mathit{S1}$ to $\mathit{S3}$ (a distance of 10.8~m) of 37~ns, while a proton with the same momentum will have a time of flight of 55~ns.
For the same two particles travelling between $\mathit{S2}$ and $\mathit{S4}$ (a distance of 12.7~m), the charged pion would have a time of flight of 43~ns and the proton would have a time of flight of 65~ns.
Figure~\ref{fig:s1s3PredTimes} shows the predicted time of flight for various particle species across the $\mathit{S1}-\mathit{S3}$ distance and the $\mathit{S2}-\mathit{S4}$ distance respectively.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:s3tof} shows the time of flight spectrum recorded in the $\mathit{S3}$ timing point for varying numbers of moderator blocks.
The quicker peak is formed by minimum ionizing particles, while the peak at higher values of $\mathit{t_{S3}} - \mathit{t_{S1}}$ corresponds to protons.
The proton peaks show a double peak feature, with a smaller delayed peak closely following the main proton peak; this feature appeared after the beam was steered so that the full 2.5 degree off-axis angle could be achieved and is due to beam scattering in the steering magnets.
Figure~\ref{fig:utofNoBend}, left and right, shows the proton peak for unsteered beam and the double peak structure is gone.
In the black curve, which shows the 0 block data, a deuteron peak can be seen centered at 95~ns.
The timing ranges for particle species selection are chosen using the analytic expectations shown in Figure~\ref{fig:s1s3PredTimes}.

  \caption{$\mathit{S3}$ time of flight spectra for varying numbers of moderator blocks.}
  \label{fig:s3tof}
\end{figure}

To calculate the correct time of flight, timing delays caused by cabling and equipment are taken into account.
The same method is used to correct the measurements of the time of flight between $\mathit{S1}$ and $\mathit{S3}$, and $\mathit{S2}$ and $\mathit{S4}$.
The initial recorded time, $t_i$, is either $t_{\mathit{S1}}$ or $t_{\mathit{S2}}$ while the final recorded time, $t_f$ is then $t_{\mathit{S3}}$ or $t_{\mathit{S4}}$ respectively.

A signal measured in the more downstream of the detectors ($\mathit{S3}$ or $\mathit{S4}$) which occurs at a true time $t_f$ will be recorded as happening at a time
\begin{align}
  t_{f_{\text{rec}}} = t_f + t_{f_{\text{delay}}} \,,
  \label{eq:delayS4}
\end{align}
while a signal measured in the same DAQ from the more upstream of the detectors ($\mathit{S1}$ or $\mathit{S2}$) will be recorded at a time
\begin{align}
  t_{i_{\text{rec}}} = t_{i} + t_{i_{\text{delay}}} \,,
  \label{eq:delayS2}
\end{align}
where $t_{f_{\text{delay}}}$ and $t_{i_{\text{delay}}}$ are the total delays caused by cabling and equipment between the respective detectors and the DAQ.
Therefore, the true time of flight, $t_{f} - t_{i}$, will be given by
\begin{align}
  t_{f} - t_{i} = t_{f_{\text{rec}}} - t_{i_{\text{rec}}} - \left( t_{f_{\text{delay}}} - t_{i_{\text{delay}}} \right) \,,
  \label{eq:delayTof}
\end{align}
where $t_{f_{\text{delay}}} - t_{i_{\text{delay}}}$ is to be determined.
In order to determine $t_{f_{\text{delay}}} - t_{i_{\text{delay}}}$, a Gaussian is fitted to the faster peak observed in the 0 block data which is thought to be produced by minimum ionizing particles.

A charged pion with a momentum of 0.8~GeV/c will have a speed of $0.985c$ and will therefore traverse the distance between $\mathit{S2}$ and $\mathit{S4}$ (12.7~m) in a time of 42.6~ns.
When a Gaussian is fitted to the data, the mean of the MIP peak lies at $(86.31 \pm 0.02)~\text{ns}$.
Rearranging Equation~\ref{eq:delayTof} and substituting in 86.31~ns for $t_{\mathit{S4}_{\text{rec}}} - t_{\mathit{S2}_{\text{rec}}}$ gives a value for $t_{\mathit{S4}_{\text{delay}}} - t_{\mathit{S2}_{\text{delay}}}$ of 43.7~ns.
This shift is applied to all measured times to give the value of $t_{\mathit{S4}} - t_{\mathit{S2}}$ used in the analysis.
The process is repeated for the $\mathit{S3}$ data.
In this case the required shift is 65.0~ns.

The mass distribution calculated for the dataset without moderator blocks is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:s3tof_mass}.
The time difference between $\mathit{S3}$ and $\mathit{S1}$ counters corresponding to a single particle was converted to the mass of the particle.
Starting from the equation for relativistic momentum
\begin{align}
p = \gamma m v \,,
\end{align}
where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $v$ is the speed of particle and $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.
Squaring and rearranging gives
\begin{align}
  m^{2} = \frac{p^{2}}{\gamma^{2} v^{2}} \,,
\end{align}
before the Lorentz factor is expanded to give
\begin{align}
  m^{2} = p^{2}\left(\frac{1}{v^{2}} - \frac{1}{c^{2}}\right) \,,
\end{align}
where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum. Expressing $v$ as the distance between $\mathit{S1}$ and $\mathit{S3}$ ($x_{\mathit{S3}}-x_{\mathit{S1}} = 10.8~\text{m}$) divided by the time difference between the $\mathit{S1}$ and $\mathit{S3}$ counters ($t_{\mathit{S3}} - t_{\mathit{S1}}$) and expressing in natural units 
\begin{equation} 
  m^2 = p^2 \left( 
  \left(\frac{t_{\mathit{S3}}-t_{\mathit{S1}}}{x_{\mathit{S3}}-x_{\mathit{S1}}} \right)^2
  - 1  \right) \,,
  \label{eq:recoMass}
\end{equation}
where the particle momentum $p$ is assumed to be 0.8~GeV/c.
The proton and pion mass positions in Figure~\ref{fig:s3tof_mass} are indicated by vertical arrows.
One can clearly observe distinct peaks corresponding to protons and deuterons. 
The insert in the figure shows a zoomed region corresponding to the MIPs.

For the data collected in $\mathit{S3}$, both timing and signal amplitude cuts were used to select protons and MIPs.
Figure~\ref{fig:TvsA} shows an example of the signal size recorded in one of the SiPMs on one of the scintillator bars against the measured value of $t_{\mathit{S3}} - t_{\mathit{S1}}$.
At the beam energies used, due to their higher mass, the protons typically deposit more energy in the detector, resulting in the observation of greater amplitudes.
Therefore, to reduce the number of background events in the proton sample, a minimum signal amplitude is required.
This cut varies, depending on the SiPM in question and is determined from distributions such as those shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TvsA}. 
The cut values vary in the range 0.125~V to 0.3~V.

Figure~\ref{fig:s4tof} shows the variation in the time of flight spectrum as recorded by $\mathit{S4}$ with a changing number of moderator blocks.
This spectrum is given by the difference in time between observation of a coincidence in the $\mathit{S1}$ and $\mathit{S2}$ timing points and a signal being recorded in $\mathit{S4}$ (the definition of an $\mathit{S4}$ signal is given above).

Additionally, the plot has also been corrected for the differing efficiencies of the various bars and for the variation in efficiency as a function of position along the bar, as described in Section~\ref{timeofflightanalysissubsec}.}
  \label{fig:s4tof}

Additionally, the reconstructed mass distribution for particles travelling from $\mathit{S2}$ to $\mathit{S4}$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:s4tof_mass}, produced using Equation~\ref{eq:recoMass}.
In this case, $x_{\mathit{S4}}-x_{\mathit{S2}} = 12.7~\text{m}$.
Unlike the same distribution produced for particles travelling from $\mathit{S1}$ to $\mathit{S3}$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:s3tof_mass}), no deuteron peak is visible.
This is thought to be due to the attenuation of deuterons within the walls of the TPC.
Additionally, the predicted proton position does not line up with the measured proton position. 
This is again thought to be caused by the positioning of the TPC in front of $\mathit{S4}$.
Protons passing through the TPC lose energy, resulting in them having less than the original 0.8~GeV/c beam momentum.
In turn, this leads to protons having a larger reconstructed mass than predicted.
The displacement of the proton mass peak in Figure~\ref{fig:s4tof_mass} is consistent with the expected energy loss in the vessel walls.

A correction is made for the variation in particle detection efficiency between the bars and for the variation in this efficiency as a function of the position along each bar.
This correction is performed using the cosmic ray flux.
It is assumed that the flux of cosmic rays passing through each part of $\mathit{S4}$ is equal.
Each $\mathit{S4}$ bar is divided into 7~cm segments for analysis, and the number of cosmic rays passing through each segment is measured by assuming that all signals occurring outside of beam spills are produced by cosmic rays.
The efficiency is then found from this distribution by normalising the bin with the highest number of cosmic ray signals to 1.
An example of one of these distributions is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:s4PosEff}.
Events are then weighted according to the bar in which they are observed and their measured position along this bar.
The weight applied is the inverse of the value shown in Figure~\ref{fig:s4PosEff}.
Additionally, a further weight is applied to all $\mathit{S4}$ events of 1.25.
This weight is derived from tests performed on the $\mathit{S4}$ bars with a $^{90}$Sr source.
Using this source, it was determined that the maximum measured rate of signals produced by the $^{90}$Sr source was equal to 0.8 of the true rate.

Using Figure~\ref{fig:s4tof}, protons and MIPs are selected with timing cuts. 
These timing cuts are chosen by fitting a sum of signal and background functions to the time of flight spectra shown in Figure~\ref{fig:s4tof}. 
The signal functions are taken to be Gaussians while the background is taken to be flat. 
An example of this is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fitEx}.
The particles in the quicker timing window (those for which $36~\text{ns}<t_{\mathit{S4}}-t_{\mathit{S2}}<51~\text{ns}$) are considered to be minimum ionizing particles while those in the slower timing window (those for which $62~\text{ns}<t_{\mathit{S4}}-t_{\mathit{S2}}<125~\text{ns}$) are considered to be protons.
