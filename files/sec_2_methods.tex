\section{Beam Line and Detectors}
\label{hptpcPaper:sec:Methods}

    \subsection{Beam Test Overview}
    The beam test took place in the 0.8~GeV T10 beam line, East Area at the Proton Synchrotron in CERN from the 15th August to the 18th September 2018.
    The results in this paper use data taken on the 31st August and 1st September, during which the setup configuration was varied as described below.
    The primary components of the  experimental setup for the data taking period is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:setup}.
    \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{files/Figures/T10Diagram.jpg}
    	\caption{Beam test configuration}
    		\label{fig:setup}
    \end{figure}
    The centre of the HPTPC Prototype was placed 13~m from the wire chamber at the beam entrance. Three ToF constituents, labeled S1 to S3, were placed upstream of the TPC, while the fourth, labeled S4, was placed directly downstream. Both the TPC and ToF systems were placed at an off-axis angle with respect to the direction of the beam.
    Additionally, a variable number of blocks of acrylic moderator, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:modblocks}, were placed in the beamline, upstream of S1.

    \includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{files/Figures/ModeratorBlocks.jpg}
    	\caption{Acrylic Moderator Blocks}
    		\label{fig:modblocks}
    \end{figure}
    
    A system of moderator blocks was located between the beam wire chambers and ToF constituent S1.  The system is composed of a stand on which up to four polystyrene AxBxC cm blocks can be placed. Figure~\ref{fig:modblocks} shows the stand with four blocks on it. The moderator blocks have the effect of both reducing the energy of incoming particles as well as scattering protons at higher angles than minimum ionizing particles, thus increasing the proton to MIP ratio at off-axis angles from the beam. 
    
    Data was taken with the beam primarily at 0.8~GeV, and with each configuration of 0 to 4 moderator blocks. Figure~INSERT shows the typical composition of the beam upstream of S1 at 0.8~GeV. Beam spills are approximately 500~ms in length with 5-10~s between spills.  
    
%    Moderator blocks were used in order to cause a spread in the incoming beam.
%    The blocks cause protons to scatter through a larger angle than pions and other minimum ionising particles (MIP), increasing the off-axis proton pion ratio.
%    The effect of this, together with placing the TPC and ToF systems off axis was to allow a measurement of protons with a lower pion background.
%    This technique also had the effect of reducing the average momentum of the measured particles.
%    Data were taken for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 moderator blocks in turn.
%    The beam ran with an energy of 0.8~GeV, and primarily comprised protons and pions, as well as muons and electrons. 
%    Beam spills were approximately 500~ms in length, with 5-10~s between spills.
%    The ratio of protons to pions expected in the T10 beam  is shown in figure~\ref{beamcharacteristics}.
%    From this figure, the expected on axis proton pion ratio at 0.8~GeV is approximately 1:6.

	\subsection{Upstream beam counters S1 and S2}
	
	S1 and S2 are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:WHAT}. S1 is a $40\times40\times5$~mm$^3$ plastic scintillator tile which is attached to four 1'' Hamamatsu R4998 phototubes from four ends for the light readout. The time resolution of the counter, as measured by the DAQ system of the upstream ToF, was about 30 ps. 
	
	S2 was placed 1~m downstream of S1. The size of the scintillator tile, $120\times120\times5$~mm$^3$, was adjusted to account for the beam divergence in the moderator blocks. The light was collected by a 2'' PMT R13089 which was connected to the scintillator via long light-guide as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:WHAT}. 
	
	The analog signals from one of the S1 PMTs (WHICH ONE??) and S2 PMT were fed into discriminator units set at AA mV and BB mV respectively. These two signals were fed into a coincidence unit, and the coincidence of the two signals was used by the S3 and S4 ToF constituents for time-of-flight analyses. 

    
\subsection{Upstream Time of Flight instrumentation (S3)}

The S3 `upstream' ToF constituent sits just upstream of the HPTPC prototype in the beamline. The sketch of the S3 ToF constituent is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:S3sketch}. The detector is composed of 22 staggered bars:  20 bars with dimensions $1.68 \times 6 \times 1$~cm$^3$ and 2 bars of  $1.5 \times 6 \times 1$~cm$^3$ placed on top and bottom.
The overlap between bars was set to 5~mm, thus the active area of the detector was approximately 1.68 m $\times$ 1.22 m.
     \begin{figure}
      \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{files/Figures/uToF_sketch.pdf}
    	\caption{Sketch of the S3 wall}
    		\label{fig:S3sketch}
    \end{figure}
    
The bars are made from the plastic EJ-200, which provides a suitable optical attenuation length 4~m and fast timing (rise time of 0.9~ns and decay time 2.1~ns) REFERENCE?. The scintillation emission spectrum of EJ-200 is primarily in the violet region of the visible spectrum. REFERENCE?

Arrays of eight $6 \times 6$~mm$^2$ area silicone photomultipliers (SiPMs) from Hamamatsu Photonics were coupled to both ends of the bar to collect scintillation photons. Anode signals of SiPMs have been read out and summed by an 8-channel SiPM anode readout integrated circuit MUSIC-R1. %The construction of the prototype was a joint effort between groups of Geneva and Zurich universities as a part of R\&D for the Timing detector of the SHIP experiment \cite{AK}.

A 64-ch SAMPIC  module was used for the data acquisition. A SAMPIC chip is a Waveform and Time to Digital Converter (WTDC) multichannel ASIC which provides a raw time with an ultrafast analog memory allowing fine timing extraction as well as other parameters of the pulse \cite{SAMPIC}. Each channel integrates a discriminator that can trigger itself independently or participate to a more complex trigger. 

A mean time of light signals detected at two ends of a single bar provides a time reference with the resolution of about 100 ps, while the time difference gives a position of the interaction along the bar, with a resolution of NNN. An example of a reconstructed $XY$ distribution is shown in Figure \ref{ }.

    
    

%    The placement of each of the four time of flight constituents in respect to the TPC is shown in figure~\ref{fig:S1S2S3S4}.

\subsection{Downstream Time of Flight instrumentation (S4)}
	
The S4 `downstream' ToF constituent sits just downstream of the HPTPC prototype in the beamline. It consists of 10 bars of Nuvia plastic scintillator. Attached to either end of each of these scintillator bars is a 5" Hamamatsu R6594 photomultiplier tube. The bars are arranged in two rows of five, such that there is complete coverage for any beam particles incident upon the detector. Diagrams of the S4 wall, along with its dimensions are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:dstofFront} and~\ref{fig:dstofDiagonal}. The time resolution of the bars and PMTs was measured to be 1~ns. The corresponding spatial resolution of the bars and PMTs was measured to be 8.3~cm.
    
    \begin{figure}[ht]    
    	\begin{minipage}[t]{.48\textwidth}

    		\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{files/Figures/dstofFront.png}

    		\label{fig:dstofDiagonal}
    	\end{minipage}
    \end{figure}
    
All 20 of the PMTs have their anode signals read out using NIM discriminators which are then fed into a time-to-digital converter. A signal in S4 was considered to have occurred if a signal was seen in both PMTs on the same bar within 20~ns of each other. 

Additionally, a signal was also fed into the same time-to-digital converter whenever there was a coincidence between the $S1$ and $S2$ timing points. When calculating the time of flight of a given particle, this time of coincidence was used as first timing point.

\subsection{The HPTPC Prototype}
The prototype was built at Royal Holloway, University London.  The steel vessel was rated to 6~barA of pressure, and the walls of the vessel were 4~cm thick (THIS NEEDS CHECKING).
The TPC comprised thin steel mesh electrodes (one cathode and three anodes), and 12 copper rings to create the uniform drift field. The drift distance produced was 48~cm, with the anodes separated by 1~mm. Data taking with the TPC made use of both optical and charge readout.The vessel, electrodes, and drift region of the TPC are shown in figure~\ref{fig:TPC}.
    
     \begin{figure}
      \centering

    	\caption{Cross-sectional view of the TPC; the thing mesh electrodes and copper ring drift volume can be seen inside the steel vessel}
    		\label{fig:TPC}
    \end{figure}
    
The centre of the TPC was placed 13~m from the beam entrance with S3 and S4 directly upstream and downstream of the vessel, respectively. Throughout the run, the TPC was filled with either pure Argon, or a combination of Argon and a small percentage of quencher.


%\subsection{Beam Taking Periods}

%The data taken for the following studies was accrued over the course 
%WHAT DATA AND WHEN (Maybe this goes earlier)
 %(this is described above now)   
\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Analysis Goals}
The primary aims of the use of S1-S4 was to make measurements of the flux of particles entering and exiting the TPC vessel, and to perform particle identification using the time of flight measurement.
Protons can be distinguished from particles that are close to minimum ionising (pions, muons, and electrons) which travel the distance from S1 to S3 or S4 in a shorter time.
Distinguishing these MIPs from one another is more difficult (INCLUDE MORE HERE)
From the measurements of particle flux, it is possible to measure the ratio of protons to other particles over the range of off-axis angles covered by the S3 and S4 walls, and the energy spectrum entering and exiting the TPC.

\subsection{Analysis Methods}

	Figure~\ref{fig:s4tof} shows the variation in the time of flight spectrum as recorded by $S4$ with a changing number of moderator blocks. 
	This spectrum given by the difference in time between observation of a coincidence in the $S1$ and $S2$ timing points and a signal being recorded in $S4$ (the definition of an $S4$ signal is given above).
	
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\begin{adjustbox}{max totalsize={.8\textwidth}{.7\textheight},center}
			\input{files/Figures/s4BkgSub_axisAdj.tex}
		\end{adjustbox}
		\caption{$S4$ time-of-flight spectra for varying numbers of moderator blocks. For all configurations, an exponentially falling background has been fitted and subtracted from the data. Additionally, the plot has also been corrected for the differing efficiencies of the various bars.}
		\label{fig:s4tof}	
	\end{figure}

	Furthermore, two corrections are applied to this measurement to give fig.~\ref{fig:s4tof}. 
	Timing delays caused by cabling and equipment are taken into account:
	A Gaussian is fitted to the peak caused by faster particles.
	All times are normalised such that the mean of this peak is at a value of $S4 - S1$ corresponding to a particle traversing the distance between $S1$ and $S4$ at the speed of light. 
	The other times are then shifted by the same amount.
	
	Additionally, the measurements are corrected for the efficiency of each bar. 
	The efficiency of a bar is calculated by dividing the number of signal hits in coincidence with an $S1-S2$ signal in each bar by the total number of PMT hits in each bar (themselves in coincidence with an $S1-S2$ signal). 
	If the number of single PMT hits which are in coincidence with $S1-S2$ signal is expressed as $N_{1PMTcoins}$ and the number of 2 PMT signals in coincidence with an $S1-S2$ signal is expressed as $N_{2PMTcoins}$, then the efficiency is given by~(\ref{eq:barEff}).
	
	\begin{equation}
		\epsilon = \frac{N_{2PMTcoins}}{N_{2PMTcoins}+N_{1PMTcoins}}
		\label{eq:barEff}
	\end{equation}
	
	Using fig.~\ref{fig:s4tof}, protons and MIPs are selected with timing cuts. 
	These timing cuts are chosen by fitting a sum of signal and background functions to the time of flight spectra shown in figure~\ref{fig:s4tof}. 
	The signal functions are taken to be Gaussians while the background is taken to be an exponential function. 
	An example of this is shown in figure~\ref{fig:fitEx}.
	The particles in the quicker timing window (those for which $t_{S4}-t_{S1}<55~\text{ns}$ and $t_{S4}-t_{S1}>40~\text{ns}$) are considered to be minimum ionizing particles while those in the slower timing window (those for which $t_{S4}-t_{S1}<105~\text{ns}$ and $t_{S4}-t_{S1}>66~\text{ns}$) are considered to be protons.

		\caption{Example of the time of flight spectrum observed in $S4$ with a combined signal and background function fitted (shown in black)}

	\end{figure}

	To produce the data used in this analysis, an exponential background function is subtracted. 
	The parameters for this function are taken from the combined signal and background function.
