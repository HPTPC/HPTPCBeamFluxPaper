    The downstream time of flight system consists of 10 bars of plastic scintillator, which form the detector medium. Attached to either end of each of these scintillator bars is a 5" Hamamatsu R6594 photomultiplier tube. The bars are arranged in two rows of five, such that there is complete coverage for any beam particles incident upon the detector. Diagrams of the downstream time of flight system are show in figure~\ref{fig:dstofFront} and~\ref{fig:dstofDiagonal}.

    All 20 of the photomultiplier tubes have their anode signals read out using NIM discriminators which are then fed into a time-to-digital converter. 
    
    A signal (i.e. an incident particle of any kind) in the downstream time of flight system was considered to have occurred if a signal was seen in both photomultiplier tubes on the same bar within 20ns of each other.
