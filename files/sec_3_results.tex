\section{Beam Flux Measurement}
\label{hptpcPaper:sec:Results}

\subsection{Flux measurements with S3}

The ToF systems are at an off-axis angle with respect to the beam axis (see table~\ref{tab:angS1} for values) in order to boost the low-momentum proton flux in the most relevant range for neutrino experiments.
This is quantified in terms of the two off-axis angles.
These angles are defined as detailed in section~\ref{sec:coord}.

  \label{fig:tpcproke}
\end{figure}

The momentum of protons reaching $\mathit{S3}$ is shown in figure~\ref{fig:s3promom}. 
The momentum of particles identified as protons was successfully reduced with increasing numbers of moderator blocks, with the range falling from 0.55-0.65~GeV/c for the unmoderated beam, to 0.30-0.45~GeV/c for 4~acrylic blocks.

Figure~\ref{fig:tpcpromom} shows the momentum spectrum of those protons arriving at the HPTPC vessel.
The angular range of the TPC is stated in table~\ref{tab:angS1}.
Here, it can be seen that the flux of low momentum protons (those with a momentum of less than 0.4~GeV/c) reaching the TPC was increased from negligible in the 0, 1, and 2 block cases to ($9.65 \pm 0.13$) per spill for the 4 block case.

Figure~\ref{fig:tpcproke} shows the kinetic energy spectrum of protons $\mathit{S3}$ crossing the time projection chamber.
Comparing figure~\ref{fig:tpcproke} with figure~\ref{fig:protonsfromargon} shows that, for the four moderator block case, the kinetic energy of protons incident upon the TPC is just above the 50~MeV region where the different neutrino interaction generators become discrepant.
These protons lose further energy within the walls of the HPTPC vessel, resulting in a flux of protons below 50~MeV within the TPC.

The combination of the use of moderator blocks and positioning the TPC in an off-axis position also caused a change in the multiplicity of protons passing through the TPC.
Figure~\ref{fig:tpcpromom} shows that the addition of 1, 2, and 3 moderator blocks increased the number of protons passing through the TPC from ($19.0 \pm 0.9$) per spill in the unmoderated case to ($108 \pm 3$) per spill in the 3 block case.
However, the addition of the fourth moderator block led to a fall in the number of protons passing through the TPC to ($21.4 \pm 0.2$) per spill.

\end{figure}

The distribution vs. off-axis angle of MIPs and protons in $\mathit{S3}$ are shown in figures~\ref{fig:s1s3mips} and~\ref{fig:s1s3protons}.
In both cases, the peak beam intensity falls and broadens in $\theta$ with the increasing number of moderator blocks. 
At off-axis angles the number of MIPs and protons is increased as the number of moderator blocks is increased.
The TPC lies within this off-axis region.
The spread of particles for unmoderated data was unexpected, as the beam was already diffuse: the peak in both figures for 0 blocks was already broad.
Therefore overscattering of protons with 3 and 4 moderator blocks occurred, and the number of protons reaching $\mathit{S3}$ fell faster than the number of MIPS.

Figures~\ref{fig:propiratio_s3_horz} and \ref{fig:propiratio_s3_vert} show the proton-MIP ratio measured in $\mathit{S3}$ as a function of the nominal off-axis angle, horizontally and vertically respectively, and for various numbers of moderator blocks.
For 0, 1, 2, and 3 moderator blocks the ratio falls to a minimum at approximately $1^{\circ}$ with respect to the beam axis.
This corresponds to the true beam centre.

As the angle moves to lower values of $\theta$, the ratio rises for these configurations while a similar effect is observed as $\theta$ increases.
The peak at lower values of $\theta$ shifts to progressively smaller values of $\theta$ as more moderator blocks are added (from approximately $\theta = -0.5^{\circ}$ for 0 blocks up to approximately $\theta = -2^{\circ}$ for the 3 block case).
At most values of $\theta$, the proton/MIP ratio falls with the addition of more moderator blocks. 
This is due to the overscattering of protons, particularly with 4 moderator blocks, which occurred due to the unmoderated beam being broader than expected.
However, at values of $\theta$ smaller than $-2^{\circ}$ the ratio is increased with the addition of some moderator blocks.

The momentum of these particles is further reduced as they pass through the steel walls of the vessel on their path to the TPC region.

\subsection{Flux measurements with S4}

Figure~\ref{fig:thetas4mip} shows the flux of particles identified as minimum ionizing particles across $\mathit{S4}$.
This flux is shown as as a function of the off-axis angles defined in section~\ref{sec:coord} for varying numbers of moderator blocks.
For all numbers of moderator blocks, the peak number of minimum ionizing particle events occurs at a value of $\theta$ between $-1^{\circ}$ and $-2^{\circ}$.
Similarly the number of proton events per spill, shown in figure~\ref{fig:thetas4pro} peaks at a value of $\theta$ of approximately $-2^{\circ}$.
The fall in the number of events between $\theta = -1^{\circ}$ and $\theta = 0^{\circ}$ is thought to be a result of the beam impinging on the vessel doors at these angles.
The positioning and shape of the pressure vessel doors means that, for particles travelling at these angles, a greater length of steel is passed through compared to those particles which strike the body of the vessel.

%The angular overlap of $\mathit{S2}$ and $\mathit{S4}$ plays a role in the position of the peak. 
%Figure~\ref{fig:angularDistS1} shows that, when observed from $\mathit{S1}$, a limited area of $\mathit{S4}$ is shadowed by the active area of $\mathit{S2}$.
%Given the requirement that a signal must be observed in $\mathit{S2}$, it is clear that all of the events that are observed in $\mathit{S4}$ are from this region of overlap.

Figure~\ref{fig:thetas4mip} also indicates that initially, an increasing number of moderator blocks results in an increased total MIP flux through $\mathit{S4}$. 
However, upon the addition of the fourth moderator block the flux of MIPs appears to fall.
This is observed due to the off-axis position of both $\mathit{S2}$ and $\mathit{S4}$, avoiding many of the unmoderated beam particles striking these detectors.
Due to scattering processes in the moderator, a greater number of MIPs are incident upon $\mathit{S2}$ and $\mathit{S4}$, with more scattering occurring with greater numbers of moderator blocks.
%The drop off in the number of MIPs observed in the four block data is likely due to the overscattering of the protons and MIPs as stated previously.

When changing from an unmoderated beam to the configuration with 1 moderator block, the proton flux shown in figure~\ref{fig:thetas4pro} initially sees an increase in the total number of events in $\mathit{S4}$.
However, upon the addition of further moderator blocks, the total number of protons observed in $\mathit{S4}$ falls.
The initial increase is similar to that for the MIP flux, with increased scattering causing more protons to pass through the off-axis $\mathit{S2}$ and $\mathit{S4}$.
The subsequent decrease is likely due to the larger loss of energy of the protons in the thicker moderator.
In turn, this leads to attenuation of protons in the pressure vessel resulting in fewer observed events in $\mathit{S4}$.

\end{figure}	

Figures~\ref{fig:propiratio_s4_horz} and~\ref{fig:propiratio_s4_vert} show the ratio of protons to minimum ionizing particles as a function of the number of moderator blocks and the two off-axis angles.
For all of the different block configurations, figure~\ref{fig:propiratio_s4_horz} shows the ratio remaining flat across $\theta$.
With the addition of moderator blocks, the ratio reduces from its highest level of 0.5 for the 0 block case, to 0.01 for the 4 block data.

Similarly, figure~\ref{fig:propiratio_s4_vert} shows the proton-MIP ratio falling with the addition of moderator blocks.
For all the different configurations, the ratio is flat across $\phi$.
%For the 0, 1, 2 and 3 block configurations the ratio rises as the vertical off-axis angle ($\phi$) moves further away from $0^{\circ}$. 
For the 4 block configuration, the value of the proton-MIP ratio is approximately 0.01 at all values of $\phi$.
As mentioned previously, this is thought to be due to the attenuation of low energy protons within the walls of the pressure vessel.

\subsection{Monte Carlo Studies}
In order to ascertain the flux of protons reaching the active region of the TPC, and verify the corrections described above, a MC study was performed. 
As the initial beam characteristics were not fully known, particle positions and momenta were drawn from the $\mathit{S3}$ distributions shown in figure~\ref{fig:s3promom}.
To study protons, the same timing cuts described in section~\ref{timeofflightanalysissubsec} were applied.
The initial simulation profile is constructed identically from the momentum profile shown in figure~\ref{fig:s3promom}.

The simulated protons are propagated through the vessel to the $\mathit{S4}$ detector.
The momentum profile of simulated protons reaching the $\mathit{S4}$ wall is shown in figure~\ref{fig:MCS4}.
A cut is set at the momentum threshold of $\mathit{S4}$ of 140~MeV/c.
The simulation shows a significant reduction in momentum as most particles have travelled through both steel walls of the TPC vessel.
In particular, in the 4 moderator block case, very few particles have survived through the second vessel wall to reach $\mathit{S4}$.
The ratio of number of protons reaching $\mathit{S4}$ to those reaching $\mathit{S3}$ is shown for both simulation and data in table~\ref{tab:ratios}, which includes the total statistical and systematic error in each case.
The agreement shown in the 0, 1, 2, and 3 block cases to within the uncertainty provided by the beam test setup provides strong evidence that efficiency corrections described in section~\ref{timeofflightanalysissubsec} are justified; it is not known if additional small quantities material were present in the beamline which are not accounted for in the statistical errors.
The larger discrepancy in the 4 block case is due to the low energy of the protons.
In this case, the proton energy spectrum is very sensitive to the any additional material in the beamline which would cause a large number of protons to be absorbed.

The number of simulated particles that penetrate the active area of the TPC are shown in figures~\ref{fig:MCTPC} and~\ref{fig:MCKE} as a function of momentum and kinetic energy respectively.
Comparing figure~\ref{fig:MCKE} with the motivation plot shown in figure~\ref{fig:protonsfromargon}, it is clear that 4 moderator blocks were required to access the momentum region of interest (below 50 MeV).
The off axis and moderator technique were therefore successful in the extent to which the proton energy was lowered.
The number of particles reaching the active area of the TPC was  per spill ($6.97 \pm  0.11$) for 4 moderator blocks, compared with ($12.6 \pm 0.7$) per spill without moderation.
